# Overall instructions
* Avoid comments where the purpose can easily be inferred from the code and variable names themselves

# How to write tests
* Keep tests small and self-contained. Do not make long chains of tests that mutate the same state, unless it's necessary for the test logic.
* See existing tests for the style and structure of the tests
